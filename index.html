      July 1989 a new star is born in the great state of california... <br />
      My second favorite NHL team is the LV Golden Knights only beacuse I truly
      value loyalty outside that I my a sports guy at all. I spend my free time
      lisening to or playing music and spending a serious amount of time with my
      lady and our dog Grim. I love nature and poetry and have found that one
      doesn't seem to really exisit without the other. Corny huh?

      I traveled an insane amount in my 20's allowin me to see over a dozen
      different countries. Traveling showed me more than I was ready to see but
      left me a little more humble and a lot less rich. I actually learned to
      code front-end for small buisnesses in S.E. Asia while living abroad.
      Nowadays I'm settled in ready to move into the next area of life focused
      on family and career. Not so corny eh?
